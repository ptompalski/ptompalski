### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Piotr, a research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service, specializing in remote sensing applications in forestry. My work focuses on developing tools and methods to analyze and manage forest resources, with R as my primary programming language.

#### ðŸŒ² My Projects

- **[lidRmetrics](https://github.com/ptompalski/lidRmetrics)** - a companion to the fantastic [{lidR}](https://github.com/r-lidar/lidR) package, offering several metrics_* functions to simplify lidar processing routines.
- **[LidarSpeedTest](https://github.com/ptompalski/LidarSpeedTest)** - testing and comparing runtimes of various point cloud processing tools.
- **[CTAE](https://github.com/ptompalski/CTAE)** - a collection of tools for calculating tree- or stand-level attributes developed for Canadian forests.
- **[MISTR](https://github.com/ptompalski/MISTR)** - implementation of Ontario's Modelling and Inventory Support Tool (MIST). A set of models used for growth and yield analysis.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions for collaboration!
