I'm Piotr, a research scientist with the Canadian Forest Service, specializing in remote sensing applications in forestry. My work focuses on developing next-generation tools and models to understand how Canada’s forests grow and change, using lidar, Landsat time series, and large-scale geospatial analytics. R is my primary programming language of choice.

#### 🌲 Forest Growth & Remote Sensing

A major part of my current work focuses on Remote-Sensing Yield Curves (RSYC) - aboveground biomass yield curves developed for Canada, using a time series of satellite data.

📦 RSYC package: https://github.com/ptompalski/RSYC

#### 🛰️ Canada Forest Lidar Coverage

I maintain a national-scale map showing airborne lidar acquisitions across Canada - an evolving resource supporting forest inventory, growth modeling, and remote-sensing research.

#### 🌲 Other Projects

- **[lidRmetrics](https://github.com/ptompalski/lidRmetrics)** - a companion to the fantastic [{lidR}](https://github.com/r-lidar/lidR) package, offering several metrics_* functions to simplify lidar processing routines.
- **[LidarSpeedTests](https://github.com/ptompalski/LidarSpeedTests)** - testing and comparing runtimes of various point cloud processing tools.
- **[CTAE](https://github.com/ptompalski/CTAE)** - a collection of tools for calculating tree- or stand-level attributes developed for Canadian forests.
- **[MISTR](https://github.com/ptompalski/MISTR)** - implementation of Ontario's Modelling and Inventory Support Tool (MIST). A set of models used for growth and yield analysis.
